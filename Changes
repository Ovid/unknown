Revision history for Perl extension Unknown::Values.

0.101   January 12,2021
        - Fix some POD. No functional change.

0.100   December 29, 2021
        - Breaking change: stringification of unknown values is now fatal
          This is to case fatal errors if you try to use an unknown value as a
          hash key or an array index.
        - Added support for the NULL object pattern (use Unknown::Values ':OBJECT')
        - Fatal unknown values are now loaded via (use Unknown::Values ':FATAL')

        - Test::Difference's eq_or_diff seems to have caused some grief with this module
          (internally trying to dereference my data). is_deeply doesn't cause the
          "Dereferencing cannot be performed on unknown values" error.
